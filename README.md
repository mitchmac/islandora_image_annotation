SUMMARY
-------

Adds the ability to add annotations to images.  This solution pack piggy backs
on top of other Islandora Solution Packs such as basic_image and large_image by
adding a new tab to existing views.  This tab includes the annotation tools.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

To enable the annotation tab for a content model visit the Islandora admin
section and choose Image Annotation.  From there you can choose which CModels
you want to integrate the annotation tool with.  You will need to tell it what
datastream to use as well, You should choose a datastream with a mimetype of
image/jpeg or image/png.  The Taxonomy Column allows the annotation tool to use
taxonomy terms for categories. 

Annotation categories also depend on the selected radio button under Annotation 
Categories.  If you want to depend on taxonomies choose administrator defined.


CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

Searching:
Included is an xslt designed for gsearch.  If this xslt is included in your
existing gsearch index xslt it will index the Annotation fields and make them
searchable in solr.  You will also need to configure the Islandora Solr client
so that it is aware of the new fields.  If you are using custom Solr request
handlers you will have to update them as well.

If you have solr configured properly and have Annotation Categories set as user
defined you will have a type ahead for the Annotations categories section.


F.A.Q.
------

If you want the annotations for book, do not check the book content model on
the admin page. In order for annotations for book you check the paged content
model.
